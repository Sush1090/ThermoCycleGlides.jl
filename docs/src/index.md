Documentation of ThermoCycleGlides.jl.

The goal of this package is to provide a non-linear solver for Heat Pump and Organic Rankine Cycle systems. It solves for pressures at the evaporator and the condensor for given pinch-point temperatures and provides a framework for plotting the solution. 
As of now the package is robust for subcritical cycle parameters. For thermodynamic properties, [Clapeyron.jl](https://github.com/ClapeyronThermo/Clapeyron.jl) is used as backend. 

For details of modeling see:
[Carnot batteries for heat and power coupling: Energy, Exergy, Economic and Environmental (4E) analysis - Laterre, Antoine](https://hdl.handle.net/2268/333259), which describes modeling for pure fluids. This package extends the method for mixtures. 

The nonlinear solver chosen is Newton-Raphson with box bounds which is inspired by the implementation in [NLboxsolve.jl](https://github.com/RJDennis/NLboxsolve.jl).

This package only supports steady-state applications.

There are 4 systems provided: 

1. Organic Rankine Cycle : `ORC`
2. Organic Rankine Cycle with internal heat exchanger : `ORCEconomizer`
3. Heat Pump : `HeatPump`
4. Heat Pump with internal heat exchanger : `HeatPumpRecuperator` 

The implemented version of these systems consist of the following components:
    
1. Compressor : Modelling with isentropic efficiency   
2. Expander : Modelling with isentropic efficiency
3. Valve : Modeled as isenthalpic process
4. Evaporator : Volumes of equal change in enthalpy.
5. Condenser : Volumes of equal change in enthalpy.
6. Heat Exchangers (no phase change) : using $\epsilon$ as effectiveness of heat exchanger.
